# FDPO ROS1 Stack (Noetic)

ROS1 (Noetic) stack for local navigation with an **HLDS HLS-LFCD2** LiDAR, beacon-based localization (w/ EKF), a navigation controller, and a Stage simulator.  
All configuration and launch wrappers live in the **`conf/`** package (single source of truth).

**Context:** developed for the **Robot Factory 4.0** competition at the **Festival Nacional de Rob√≥tica 2025**.

```bash
roslaunch simulation_stage run_sim_stage.launch
```

### Real Robot (Full Bring-up)
Brings up hardware (HAL), navigation, and HMI via `conf/`.
```bash
roslaunch conf/script/wake_up_fdpo.launch
